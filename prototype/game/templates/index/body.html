        <p>You have to make as much money as possible, while keeping ahead of the zombie horde.
            The aim of the game is to buy items when they're cheap, then sell at a profit.
            You can see on each item tab the current cost of the item as well as the price
            you bought it for.<br><br> Each day you can buy and sell as much as you want within your budget, and when you go
            to bed for the night the prices may change.  The projected change in the prices is shown on the associated graph.
            <br><br> The prices may also be changed by various events which occur over the course of the game.
            These can be seen in the events section of the page.
